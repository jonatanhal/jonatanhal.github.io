# WHO AM I

I have a lot of features, incapable of describing myself in a single
paraphragh is one of them.

I have studied Photography & worked on personal projects revolving
around my everyday life.  I started studying Python around the summer
of 2013 & have since worked towards learning programming and other
facets of computers mostly regarding technology, privacy & hacking
(which I'm fairly new to).

**I am currently looking for work, feel free to get in touch with me at
`jonatanhaltorp [at] gmail.com`**.  Use [my public key]({{ site-url}}/key),
if that's your thing.

## WHAT DO I DO

I like to code & am very much new to working with code, but
I would like to think that what I've done so far
isnt terrible by any stretch. Some of my code can be seen on my [github
