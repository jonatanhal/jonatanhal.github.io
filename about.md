# What I do

I have studied Photography & worked on personal photographic projects
revolving around my everyday life. When I was a kid I used to draw,
play games on either a PC or some console.

* **Programming**  
  Since watching some talks by
  [Mikko Hypponen](https://twitter.com/mikko) around 2013, I started
  to become interested in programming, computer security & various
  components surrounding those. So far, I've played around alot with
  **Python**, learned to hate **PHP**, fallen in love with **Golang** & only
  mananged to confused myself writing **C**.

* **Music**  
  I've been doing some music sporadically, which you can listen to on
  my [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/ism-1).  Most of the tracks
  are available under a creative-commons license & are available for
  download.

* **Music videos**  
  Previously I've also been doing
  [music-videos](https://vimeo.com/user6476808) by remixing old videos
  that I found on the lovely site [archive.org](https://archive.org)

* **Photography**  
  I wholeheartedly love analogue photography & I sit on some material
  that I've shot since around 2008 when I saved up enough money to buy
  a vintage Hasselblad 500cm camera. I still photograph sometimes &
  someday I hope on producing a book with my photographs. Alot of my
  old photographs can be seen on my [flickr-page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonatanhaltorp/).
