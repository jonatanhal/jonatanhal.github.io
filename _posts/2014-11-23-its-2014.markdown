# What?

You probably have seen it & you might have said it yourself. It's
the unofficial phrase of 2014.

> It's 2014, Why doesn't _thing_ exist?

## Things are pretty great.

At this point, we (humans) can build bridges, feed millions & recreate the
greatest things since sliced bread more times in a day than the number of
spiders we swallow in our sleep every year. Generally speaking, humans are
living in better conditions than ever before in history. We got something
right. Although, not all things are alright.

While most of the world enjoys some form of a decent way of living & most
of us have time and money to pursue not only our dreams in our own country
but abroad; a lot of people seem alarmed that the world is (only) this good
by this time.

It's getting to the point right now that I see outcries every day about the
fact that it's 2014 and something is wrong (point being, it shouldn't, because
it's 2014 and we should be better at things by this point)

For those of you playing along at home, This would be the time to create your
own `It's 2014!!`. Be creative!

>It's 2014! Why is _group of people **still** exploiting _another group of people_?.

### But, not really.
What's fascinating to me is, why now? What is it about this period in time, with
all of history leading up to this point, what makes us believe that 2014 **is**
more than it should be.

Did we just wake up on January first 2014, feeling like things SHOULD happen,
and things SHOULD change. Because at this point we SHOULD be able to do it.

What we are basically is saying that the things we are demanding or denouncing
_do exist_, it's just that we or the victim are deprived of them. We are simply
confused that we have [refrigerators that send spam-email](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/23/refrigerator-spam-email-internet-of-things-attack_n_4654566.html),
or that a thing we build & sent _into space in 2004_, [landed on a comet flying across space, some 310 _million_ miles away from our planet](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/11/12/world/comet-landing-countdown/index.html)
; and yet, we can't do [all these things](https://encrypted.google.com/#safe=off&q=%22it%27s+2014%22)
that seem so trivial, dumb and obvious.

####Maybe it's time that we stop being surprised about our own flaws in the year 2014.

There's nothing special about the year itself, and no single event is quoted in
all these outcries headlines. We just collectively know that we should know better
at this point in time.

After all, it's 2014. We as humans have never needed things to be more great in a world
as horrible we all live in. And we demand it, now perhaps more than ever.
