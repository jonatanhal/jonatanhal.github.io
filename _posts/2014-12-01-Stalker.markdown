> ###_Writer_:
> Everything I told you before...  
> is a lie. I don't give a damn about inspiration.  
> How would i know the right word for what I want?  
> How would i know that actually i don't want what I want?  
> Or that I actually don't want what I don't want?  
> They are elusive things:  
> The moment we name them, their meaning disappears,  
> melts, dissolves like a jellyfish in the sun.  
> My conscience wants vegetarianism to win over the world.  
> And my subconscious is yearning for a piece of juicy meat.  
> But what do I want?

> And there was a great earthquake.  
> And the sun became as black as sackcloth made of hair.  
> And the moon became like blood...  
> And the stars of the sky fell to the earth,  
> as a fig tree casts its unripe figs  
> when shaken by a great wind.  
> And the sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled up.  
> And every mountain and island were moved out of their places.  
> And the kings of earth and the great men  
> and the rich and the chiliarchs   
> and the strong and every free man,  
> hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains;  
> And they said to mountains and to the rocks, "Fall on us, and hide us from the presence of Him who sits on the throne,
> and from the wrath of the lamb, for the great day of His wrath has come,  
> and who is able to stand?"

> ###_Stalker_:
> You were speaking of the meaning...  
> of our... life...  
> Take music, for instance.  
> Less than anything else,  
> it is connected to reality,  
> or if connected at all, it's done mechanically, not by way of ideas,  
> just by a sheer sound, devoid of.. any associations.  
> And yet, music, as if by some miracle, gets through to our heart.  
> What is it that resonates in us in response to noise brought to harmony,  
> making it the source of the greatest delight,  
> which stuns us and brings us together?  
> What's all this needed for?  
> And most important, who needs it?  
> You would say, "No one. And for no reason."  
> Unselfishly.  
> No.  
> I don't think so.  
> After all, everything has some sense.  
> Sense and reason.

> I love your eyes, my darling friend,  
> Their play, so passionate and bright'ning,  
> When a sudden stare up you send,  
> And like heaven-blown lightning,  
> It'd take in all from end to end.  
> But there's more that I admire:  
> Your eyes when they're downcast,  
> In bursts of love-inspired fire,  
> And through the eyelash goes fast  
> A somber, dull call of desire...
