title: "Let's fuzz"
---

So I've been around computer for quite a while, playing around with
some basic programming in Golang & Python3 & it's been a great
learning experience.  You might have read my previous posts about
doing reverse-engineering & solving some basic Capture The Flag-stuff,
looking back on those posts I've did back then, they're not great by
any means.  But they're something, I dont know... maybe I'll revisit &
atleast polish them in the future.  
But today we are talking about **Fuzzing!**

I **highly** recommend watching the [presentation on fuzzing by
Ilja van Sprundel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESWxKhRgtEc) held at the 22c3 conference.
